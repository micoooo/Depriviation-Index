# Depriviation-Index

**What is the New Zealand Index of Deprivation (NZDep)?**

The NZDep is an area-based measure of socioeconomic deprivation in New Zealand. It measures the level of deprivation for people in each small area known as a statistical area (SA1).

* Decile 1 represents areas with the least deprived scores
* Decile 10 represents areas with the most deprived scores

It is important to note that:

* NZDep estimates relative socioeconomic deprivation for areas, not people.
